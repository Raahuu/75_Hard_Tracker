## Disclaimer

This project is in its development phase. You have nothing to see here as of now. If you clone this repo now, you will only see broken HTML, some colors and my ideas on how to implement this app. None of the buttons, links, text boxes, drop downs are functional right now. 

I will be updating this readme file as I keep on updating the app.
